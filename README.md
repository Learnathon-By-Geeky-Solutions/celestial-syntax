# 📌 Face Recognition-Based Attendance System

## 📖 Project Description
This project is a **Face Recognition-Based Attendance System** that automates attendance tracking using **OpenCV** and **Dlib**. It captures and compares individuals' images in real-time to mark attendance, stores the data in an **SQLite** database, and provides analytical insights such as **attendance percentage** and **student eligibility for exams**.

### 🔹 Features:
- 🎦 **Facial Recognition Attendance** - Uses OpenCV and Dlib to recognize faces and mark attendance.
- 📚 **Course-Wise Tracking** - Attendance is stored and retrieved per course.
- 📊 **Attendance Analysis** - Calculates total attendance and highlights students below the required threshold.
- 📝 **Automated Reports** - Generates attendance summaries and exam eligibility lists.
- 🌐 **Web-Based Interface** - Uses Flask to provide an interactive dashboard for attendance management.
